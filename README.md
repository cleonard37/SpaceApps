SAVE THE EARTH FROM ANOTHER CARRINGTON EVENT!

# Objectives
Your challenge is to develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm or neural network pipeline for the DSCOVR spacecraft's FC instrument to track and follow the changes in the peak solar wind speed so that DSCOVR can continue to provide early warnings of the next potential Carrington-like event that could adversely impact life and property on Earth. You can access historical solar wind data from DSCOVR and other missions to use to train your ML algorithm to correctly detect and track these solar wind peaks.
